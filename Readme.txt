 Overview

This project automates posting tweets with images stored in a Google Drive folder.
Captions are pulled from a companion Google Sheet (matched by filename), and each post is logged for tracking.

The workflow is built using **n8n** and integrates with **Google Drive, Google Sheets, and Twitter API**.



 Workflow

1. Google Drive Trigger â†’ Watches a folder for new images
2. Get Row(s) in Sheet â†’ Finds the caption for the image (matched by filename)
3. Download File â†’ Gets the image file from Google Drive
4. HTTP Request â†’ Uploads the image to Twitter (media endpoint)
5. Create Tweet â†’ Posts the image + caption
6. Append Row in Sheet â†’ Logs the post (time, file, caption, tweet ID, status)
7. Update Row in Sheet â†’ Marks the caption entry as `done`
